### Hi, I'm Marcus üñê

I am a software developer and an enthusiast of technology as a mean to change the world! My experience comprehends full stack web apps built with Node.js, TypeScript and React. As for frameworks, I've worked in projects using NestJS/Express.js in the back end and Next.js in the front end/back end. I also contribute to the tech community sharing knowledge and tips.

My currently focus is on the following study topics: 

- Front end documentation and testing;
- UI styling in a design system;
- Unit and integration testing;
- CI/CD workflows;

Find me elsewhereüåê:<br/>
