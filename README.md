### Hi, I'm Marcus ‚úã

I am a software developer and an enthusiast of technology as a mean to change the world! My experience comprehends back end web apps built with Node.js and TypeScript in a modular achitecture and frameworks such as NestJS. I'm also a contributer to the tech community, sharing knowledge whenever I can!

My currently focus is on the following study topics: 

- Front end development with Next.js and React;
- TDD;
- CI/CD workflows;
- Docker for the containerization of my applications;
